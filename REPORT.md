# SSH Bruteforce Detection System - Project Documentation

## Attack Analysis: SSH Bruteforce

### Attack Description
SSH Bruteforce attacks are automated attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems by systematically trying various username/password combinations against SSH services running on port 22. These attacks are characterized by:

- **High-frequency attempts**: Rapid succession of login attempts
- **Multiple usernames**: Targeting common usernames like 'admin', 'root', 'user'
- **Failed authentication patterns**: High ratio of failed to successful logins
- **Persistence**: Continued attempts despite failures
- **Source IP patterns**: Often from suspicious IP ranges or multiple IPs

### Dataset Source
**Primary Dataset**: BETH Dataset from Kaggle
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katehighnam/beth-dataset
- **Description**: Over 8M events collected from honeypots
- **Justification**: Real-world SSH attack data from honeypot environments provides authentic attack patterns

**Fallback**: Generated synthetic dataset mimicking SSH bruteforce patterns
